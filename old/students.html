<strong>Vanessa Knoppke-Wetzel</strong><br />

<p>I’m a detail orientated designer, cartographer, geographer, and programmer experienced in and passionate about creating visual stories in a fast paced environment through geo-visualizations. Whether on my own or with a team, I thoroughly enjoy finding imaginative and creative solutions for all design requests, from exclusively print products to more complicated interactive, web-based work. I’m experienced in various kinds of work environments, ranging from production requiring rigid sets of constraints and guidelines to production involving the combination of different software and programming languages. </p>
